The documentary ‘The Slave Genesis’ deals with the social transformation of Paniya tribals, who belong to South India’s hill district of Wayanad. ‘Paniya’ literally translates to ‘worker’. These tribals—who were deployed to work in the farms of migrants (belonging to other religious sects) who trickled into Wayanad from time to time—have distinct arts and songs that reflect their identities. The prime among their songs is Penappaattu (speech of ghost), which they recite as part of funeral rituals.

The song begins with the story of Paniya community’s origin. The documentary explores the social transformation of Paniyas based on the contents of Penappattu. It proceeds through the recollections (and their rectifications) of the director, who belongs to a different religious community, but has been born and brought up in close proximity to the Paniyas.
