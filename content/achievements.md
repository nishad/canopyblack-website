CanopyBlack started producing films-both fiction and documentaries since 2007 and then showed the pace. The first commendable one was the docu-fiction entitled ‘Vizhithezhuthal (‘The Awakening’) funded by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Govt. of India through M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai, India in 2007. In 2008, a 25-minute documentary entitled ‘Reclaimed Outlets’ is produced for the same organization, which conceived on the principles of food sovereignty through the practices of the tribal communities in the Western Ghat Range of Wayanad district in Kerala. Vithappadu (Sowing Field) is another in line, which was completed in June 2013, with the collaboration of School of Folklore Studies, University of Calicut, Kerala. It is recently selected for the 7th CMS VATAVARAN 2013 Environment and Wildlife Film Festival, India, New Delhi. The documentary ‘The Slave Genesis’ deals with the social transformation of Paniya tribals, who belong to South India’s hill district of Wayanad. ‘Paniya’ literally translates to ‘worker’. The documentary is completed in the year 2017.
